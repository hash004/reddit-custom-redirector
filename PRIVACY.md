# Privacy Policy - Reddit Custom Redirector

## Overview

Reddit Custom Redirector is a browser extension that redirects Reddit links to your preferred custom domain or alternative Reddit frontend. This privacy policy explains how the extension handles user data and protects your privacy.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any personal user data.** The Reddit Custom Redirector extension operates entirely within your browser and does not collect, store, or transmit any:

- Personal information (name, email, address, etc.)
- Browsing history or web activity
- Location data
- Authentication credentials
- Communication content
- Financial information
- Health information

## Local Data Storage

The extension stores only the following configuration data locally in your browser:

1. **Custom Redirect URL**: Your preferred Reddit domain (e.g., "old.reddit.com")
2. **Extension Status**: Whether the extension is enabled or disabled

This data is stored using Chrome's local storage API and remains on your device only. It is never transmitted to external servers or third parties.

## Data Sharing

**No data is shared with third parties.** The extension:

- Does not send any data to external servers
- Does not use analytics or tracking services
- Does not communicate with remote services
- Does not share information with advertisers or data brokers

## Permissions Usage

The extension requests minimal permissions necessary for its functionality:

- **Host Permissions** (`*://reddit.com/*`, `*://www.reddit.com/*`): Required to intercept and redirect Reddit URLs
- **declarativeNetRequest**: Enables URL redirection functionality
- **storage**: Allows saving your preferences locally in your browser

These permissions are used solely for the extension's core redirect functionality and nothing else.

## Data Security

Your configuration data is stored securely within your browser using Chrome's built-in storage mechanisms. Since no data is transmitted externally, there is no risk of data breaches or unauthorized access to your information through our services.

## Data Retention

Your preferences are stored locally until you:
- Uninstall the extension
- Clear your browser's extension data
- Reset the extension settings

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes in our practices or for legal compliance. Any updates will be posted at this URL with a new effective date.
